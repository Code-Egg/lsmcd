memcapable is a client utility which is part of the libmemcached project.
However, it was not written for SASL!  What a HUGE limitation.  So I modified
it but was too lazy to include as part of libmemcached (who wants to fight
the world).  So anyway, it's here and you might want to use it if you need
to test lsmcd with SASL.  

To compile it:
   - Install libmemcached from distribution.  
   - cd into the clients directory and delete the existing memcapable.cc.
   - Set a symbolic link to the memcapable.cc here.
   - Compile the system as normal which will place a memcapable executable
     in the clients directory
     
To use it with SASL you need to export the environment variables SASL_USERNAME
and SASL_PASSWORD to the user and password you wish validated.  The program
works consistently with lsmcd.  With the distributed memcached all binary tests
should pass.  Please let us know if this is not true in your environment.

A note about SASL support with memcached.  Once it is enabled the telnet (ASCII)
support stops working.  memcached simply does crazy things.  lsmcd reports a
real error so if someone does it inadvertently they'll know why.  This 
memcapable.cc automatically disables ALL ASCII functions when a SASL parameter 
is set so there will be no accidental use of commands that will fail.

Please blame Bob Perper for this whole nonsense.  When updating lsmcd's SASL
support as well as adding SASL user key/data separation by keyword specification
I needed to retest the entire package.  This became the best mechanism as it
already tested everything, just didn't do SASL.
